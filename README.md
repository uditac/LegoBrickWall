# LegoBrickWall

I have only solved the main problem, within the stipulated time period.
I have tried to make the code modular, clean and readable with summary.

Introduction
The solution is best compatible with Visual Studio 2022. If one clones this project in thier local machine.
Run the application
He/She will get a prompt to enter the widtha nd height of the brick wall
Once that is provided, only with positive interger, then the brick wall is made

#Assumption: I have assumed that there is infinite number of bricks
